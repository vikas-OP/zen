		HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP 2

	HTTP 2 is built on HTTP 1.1. So the limitations of 
HTTP 1.1 are addressed with HTTP 2.
1. HOL - Head of line blocking - earlier only one TCP connection
was there between client and server, further it is increased to
6 parellel TCP connections. But still the performance is not
good as many requests need to be made. In HTTP 2 only one 
secure TCP connection is established (HTTPs is  mandatory for
HTTP 2), in which streams are created and HTTP requests are
sent as stream frames. The requests do not get blocked in 
HTTP 2 as in HTTP 1.1
2. Repetition of header data: With every HTTP request header 
data is sent in HTTP 1.1. But in HTTP2, it is not the case. 
Even header data can be compressed in HTTP 2, in HTTP 1.1
header data is not compressed.
3. PUSH: In HTTP 2, server can give PUSH frames, which are
mandatory additional resources for the web page that are
sent ahead with the HTTP request.
