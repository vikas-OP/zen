		WHY SEMANTIC ELEMENTS

	HTML was originally created as a markup language to
share documents on the internet in the early days. It was only
used for scientific purposes. Now-a-days, people use web for
other things as well. So, designing attractive web pages has 
begun. Programmers used many hacks and non-semantic elements
to group the elements such as div. HTML 5 is relatively new 
and new semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <aside>,
<article>, <section>, <nav> are added. They deliver different
advantages. They describe their meaning in human and machine
readable way. They have great accessibility. For example, 
screen readers can better describe the web pages when semantic 
elements are used. This can help people with sight impairment.
Other advantage is consistent code. Now programmers for 
designing navigation bar can use <nav> instead of <div class
= "nav">, <div id = "navigate"> etc..
