		GET   vs  POST

	GET is used to fetch data from server. The parameters 
are given in the url. For example, www.abc.com?param=value.
There is a limit on maximum url length. GET requests can be 
cached and bookmarked. It is a safe method which means it has
no effect on the server data. This method should not be used
when sensitive data is involved. GET method is idempotent which 
means how many times it is requested the outcome will not change.

	POST is used to create data and update in the resources.
The parameters are given in the body. There is no limit on url 
length. The POST request data is not cached or bookmarked. 
It is an unsafe method which means the server data can be 
changed using this method. This method is not idempotent which means
for every other request the outcome will be different.
