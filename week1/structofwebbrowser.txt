		Structure of web browser
	It contains several components namely
1. User Interface
2. Browser Engine
3. Rendering Engine
4. JS engine
5. UI Backend
6. Networking and 
7. Data Storage.

User Interface : All the content that is displayed on
the web page comes under user interface. It is there for
graphical interaction between user and server.

Browser Engine : It constructs the DOM and CSSSOM, it also 
facilitates the communication between user interface
and rendering engine.

Rendering Engine : Takes the HTML and CSS and paints(renders)
the screen with visual content.

JS engine: There are scripts written in almost all the web
pages. This is used to interpret the JS and execute it.

UI backend: It supports the rendering engine for displaying
different elements in GUI.

Networking: It uses HTTP to request information from 
the internet (Resource gathering). Also makes calls to the DNS.

Data Storage: As the name suggests, it is used for storing
data. Browser saves data such as cookies.

The steps involved in working of web browser are listed below:
1. Resource gathering : The networking component is used 
to gather different web pages, pictures etc.. required
for the current web page.
2. Parsing HTML to create DOM tree.
3. Creating Render tree from DOM tree: This render tree 
contains the visual elements.
4. Laying out the elements of render tree on display.
5. Painting the elements of render tree with the help of 
UI backend.
