			DOM
	
	Document Object Model is object oriented representation
of the HTML document. HTML elements are the objects, they 
are represented in a tree structure. A web page can be viewed 
in a browser and also can be viewed as HTML source code, but
the document is same in both the cases. Similarly, DOM is also
a representation of the web page in tree structure so that
it can be manipulated by a scripting language such as JS.

	DOM is a tree structure with node and child elements
so that the search time of particular HTML elements is low
which inturn increases the performance in terms of creating, 
deleting and modifying elements. This structure starts with 
window for which only child is html. There are two children
of html which are head and body. There are several children 
of head and body. This hierarchical structure also enables 
the advantage of inheritance.
